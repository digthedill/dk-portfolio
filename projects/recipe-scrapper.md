## About

The idea for this site/app came from my Mom. She always keeps tabs of recipe sites open on her computer so she won't lose the recipe. I offered her this so she can close out her tabs.
\
This project's frontend is built with Vue.js and Bootstrap. I used this project to get familiar with Vue. The authentication is handled by firebase. I like the easy googleAuth setup and used it for this app.
\
The node scrapper is built using Axios and Cheerio. The focus of this web scraper is for food recipes across different websites. The challenge was manually scrapping websites.
